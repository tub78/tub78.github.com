As often as possible, which is not often enough, I attend evening talks on science and technology.

Some venues that I frequent are:

 * [NYC Machine Learning @ Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Machine-Learning/)
 * [NY Open Statistical Computing @ Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/)
 * [NYC Predictive Analytics @ Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Predictive-Analytics/)
